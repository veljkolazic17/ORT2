VERY simple cpu design

Procesor is made out of 4 simple phases FETCH which fetches the instruction from ROM memmory, ADDR phase, FETCH phase 
which executes the instruction and a very simple INTR phase which only works with maskable interrupts.
This was a simple uni project and as that i did not provide much points.
If you want to know more about processor, there is a pdf file that explains more in Serbian.
